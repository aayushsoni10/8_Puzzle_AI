# 8_Puzzle_AI
Generating (solvable, plausible) instances of 8-puzzle initial states, collecting information 
about the height and/or size of the tree/graph searched, the number of
nodes, and then arrive at the estimation of an average branching factor b 
such that, given n as the number of nodes generated and m
the maximum depth reached, then
    n = (approx) k*((b)^(d+1))
with the constant k satisfying
    0<k<2.
